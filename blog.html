          <h2>About PUBG</h2>
          <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (also known as PUBG: Battlegrounds) is an online multiplayer battle royale
            game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Bluehole. The game is based on
            previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000
            Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In
            the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to
            kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map
            decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The
            last player or team standing wins the round. <a href="pubg.html"> read more.</a></p>

          <h2>About FREE FIRE</h2>
          <p>A battle royale match consists of up to 50 players parachuting onto an island in search of weapons and
            equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position and take weapons and
            supplies to extend their battle life.

            When players join a game, they are in a plane which flies over an island. While the plane is flying over the
            island, the players can jump wherever they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away
            from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical
            equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the
            island.<a href="free.html"> read more.</a></p>

          <p>Subway Surfers is an endless runner mobile game co-developed by Kiloo[1] and SYBO Games,[2] private
            companies based in Denmark. It is available on Android, iOS, Kindle, and Windows Phone platforms and uses
            the Unity game engine.[3] In the game, players take the role of young graffiti artists who, upon being
            caught in the act of "tagging" a metro railway site, run through the railroad tracks to escape from the
            inspector and his dog. As they run, they grab gold coins, power-ups, and other items along the way while
            simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects, and they can also jump on top of the trains
            and surf with hoverboards to evade capture until the character crashes into an obstacle, gets caught by the
            inspector, or gets hit by a train, at which point the game will be over. Special events, such as the Weekly
            Hunt, can result in in-game rewards and characters.<a href="subway.html"> read more.</a></p>
