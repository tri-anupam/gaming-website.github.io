			<h2>About PUBG</h2>
			<p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (also known as PUBG: Battlegrounds) is an online multiplayer battle royale
				game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Bluehole. The game is based on
				previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000
				Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In
				the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to
				kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map
				decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The
				last player or team standing wins the round.</p>

			<h2>Who invented PUBG?<br /></h2>
			<p>Six years ago, Brendan Greene was 37, divorced and making $300 a month. Today he is a creator of the
				massively popular “battle royale” genre and one of its top games, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, which
				brought in an estimated $1 billion in revenue in 2018.</p><br />
			<h2>Which country made the PUBG game?<br /></h2>
			<p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PubG) is a battle-royale video game, similar to the global hit Fortnite,
				in which 100 players fight for survival. PubG was developed in South Korea but Tencent had licensed the
				game and was testing a mobile app version in China.</p><br />
			<h2>Why is PUBG famous?<br /></h2>
			<p>A lot of PUBG's popularity comes from the appeal of the base concept. In a normal game, 100 people enter,
				and one person leaves. This sort of mass-scale combat has long been a dream of gamers, but in most
				cases, games of this scale have been abandoned or ignored.</p><br />
			<h2>Is PUBG dangerous?<br /></h2>
			<p>It can lead to addiction and harm mental health
				This addiction can also harm your mental health, as recognized by the World Health Organization in 2018.
				PUBG Mobile can cause anxiety and stress in gamers, due to the lack of social interaction</p><br />
			<h2>Is PUBG banned in China?<br /></h2>
			<p>PUBG as a game was banned in China back in 2017. Tencent Games, a part of Tencent Holdings, got into an
				agreement with the game developers to release the game in China, as a mobile version. And thus, started
				the development of PUBG Mobile as we now know it, which was eventually released globally in 2018</p>
