          <h2>About GOD OF WAR</h2>
          <p>God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console, and has become a flagship title for the PlayStation brand, consisting of eight games across multiple platforms with a ninth currently in development. Based in ancient mythology, the story follows the titular protagonist, Kratos, a Spartan warrior and later the God of War, who was tricked into killing his family by his former master, the original Greek god of war Ares. This sets off a series of events that leads to wars with the mythological pantheons. The Greek mythology era of the series sees Kratos follow a path of vengeance due to the machinations of the Olympian gods, while the Norse mythology era, which introduces his son Atreus as a secondary protagonist, shows an older Kratos on a path of redemption, which inadvertently brings the two into conflict with the Norse gods.</p>

            God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. ... Based in ancient mythology, the story follows Kratos, a Spartan warrior who was tricked into killing his family by his former master, the Greek God of War Ares.</p><br/>
            <h2>How long does God of War take to complete?<br/></h2>
            <p>According to HowLongToBeat the average player can expect to take around 17-25 hours to complete the game, but if you are a completionist then you can expect to spend as much as 50 hours playing through it.<br/></p>
            <h2>How many gods has Kratos killed?<br/></h2>
            <p>We'll update this list in the future as Kratos kills more of Greek mythology's most important gods and people, which at current count is 23. Non-gods and nobodies that Kratos has killed is currently a 15 digit number.<br/></p>
            <h2>Does god of war get easier?<br/></h2>
            <p>Turning the difficulty down to normal, I found the game flowed much better. Combat was much more enjoyable. Yes, it does become somewhat easy later on in the game- once you upgrade your skills and armor. But the difference in gameplay is easily preferable.<br/></p>
            <h2>What is the hardest God of War game?<br/></h2>
            <p>God of War 3 is the hardest God of war game because it's bosses and levels are too hard for everyone.<br/></p>
            <h2>Why is Kratos so strong?<br/></h2>
            <p>Kratos is super strong because of his agoge training and his demi-godhood (he's about as strong as Herakles or Achilles). Help from the gods clearly contributes too, but it's his rage against Ares that pushes him to the limit in the end.</p>
