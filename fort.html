      <h2>About FORTNITE</h2>
      <p>Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three
        distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the
        World, a cooperative hybrid-tower defense-shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like
        creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a
        free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite
        Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and
        Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018.
        While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in
        particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in
        less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in
        gross revenue up until December 2019.</p>

    <div class="main-content2">
      <p>Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the
        last one standing. It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where strategic thinking
        is a must in order to survive. There are an estimated 125 million players on Fortnite.Fortnite is an online
        video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions
        that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine.Fortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player
        game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or
        four players). ... This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last
        player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.<br />
      <h2>Is fortnite OK for kids?<br /></h2>
      <p>But many people don't think Fortnite is right for kids. Players shoot each other and win only after 99 other
      players in each game have been killed. The violence earned the game a rating of T (for Teen)—meaning it's not
      suitable for kids under the age of 13.<br /></p>
      <h2>Is fortnite dying?<br /></h2>
      <p>In 2019, however, the game dropped down quite at bit- amassing $1.8 billion, but still managing to stay in the
      billion-dollar games club. We are yet to see how Fortnite is going to do in the year 2020. A raging debate has
      taken over the Fortnite community in the past few days.<br /></p>
      <h2>Should fortnite be banned?<br /></h2>
      <p>Prince Harry says video game Fortnite is 'irresponsible' and should be banned. ... Prince Harry added that he
      thinks Fortnite is too addictive, especially for young players. “It's created to addict, an addiction to keep you
      in front of a computer for as long as possible,” the prince said Thursday. “It's so irresponsible.”<br /></p>
      <h2>Who banned from fortnite for life?<br /></h2>
      <p>Jarvis Khattri, 17, was banned from "Fortnite" for life after he uploaded a video of himself using software to
      cheat in the game. Jarvis, a member of the esports organization FaZe Clan, has earned thousands of dollars playing
      "Fortnite" and making videos about the game for his YouTube followers.</p>
